SECTION 5 — Closure Line + FAQ Accordion

Place this section below the Albums horizontal cards, with good spacing.

Centered closure text (large, bold):

Keep stories alive, because stories are what make us.


Below it, add a FAQs block with collapsible dropdowns (accordion).
Each item should expand/collapse smoothly, mobile-first, touch-friendly.

FAQ Items (use exactly):

What is Kahani?
A simple way to save your loved ones’ voices and stories — forever.

How does it work?
We send story questions on WhatsApp. They reply with voice notes. We turn those into a beautiful memory book.

Who is it for?
Anyone who wants to keep their parents’, grandparents’, or loved ones’ stories alive.

Is it private?
Completely. Your chats and voice notes stay encrypted and safe — always.

Can I redo or delete a story?
Yes. You can re-record or ask us to remove any message before your book is made.

What do I get in the end?
A keepsake book with their stories, photos, and QR codes to hear their voices.

Do I need an app?
No app, no login. Everything happens on WhatsApp.

Can they speak in Hindi or another language?
Yes. Any Indian language works — the book keeps their voice just as it is.

How long does it take?
Usually 2–4 weeks after the stories are sent.

Can I gift this?
Absolutely. You can gift a Kahani to anyone you love — one link starts their journey.
