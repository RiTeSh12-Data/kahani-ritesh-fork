Build a mobile-first, swipeable vinyl audio gallery as a single-page React app (Vite + React + TypeScript). No backend. Use plain CSS modules (no Tailwind). Optimize for phones and desktop.

Assets you can assume are attached with this prompt and available to import:

src/assets/kahani-logo.png ← This is the logo I will attach

src/assets/cover.jpg ← album cover I will replace later

src/assets/track1.mp3, track2.mp3, track3.mp3 (placeholders)

✅ Features & Flow

Intro screen (slide 0)

Shows Album Cover (cover.jpg), Album Title, Artist.

Kahani logo (kahani-logo.png) fixed at the center bottom of the viewport.

Subtle hint: “Swipe → to start”.

Swiping right goes to Track 1. Swiping left does nothing.

Track screens (slides 1..n)

Top: Track Name (centered).

Middle: a large vinyl record with a central label that displays the SAME album cover image from the intro:

The album cover appears as a circular image in the middle of the record (cropped to a circle).

When playing, the entire record rotates, including the center image.

When paused, rotation stops exactly (don’t reset angle).

Center overlay: Play/Pause button. Tapping anywhere on the record OR the button toggles play/pause.

Below: elapsed / total time (mm:ss / mm:ss), live-updated.

Swiping right/left moves to next/previous track. Navigating away auto-pauses the current audio.

Controls

Tap record or button = toggle play/pause.

Keyboard (desktop): Left/Right arrows = prev/next track; Space = toggle play/pause.

Mouse drag left/right works like swipe.

Auto-pause when the tab loses visibility.

Only one track plays at a time.

Responsive

On phones: vinyl ~70–80% of width with padding.

On larger screens: center content; max-width ~480–640px.

Accessibility

Play button is a <button> with aria-pressed + aria-label.

Current time announced with role="timer".

Keep focus outlines.

export type Track = {

  title: string;   // Track Name
  artist: string;  // Artist name
  audioSrc: string;
};

export const ALBUM = {
  title: "Memories of Home",
  artist: "Grandma Asha",
  coverSrc: "/src/assets/cover.jpg",        // used on intro AND as vinyl center image
  logoSrc: "/src/assets/kahani-logo.png",   // ATTACHED WITH PROMPT
};

  { id: "t1", title: "First Day of School", artist: "Grandma Asha", audioSrc: "/src/assets/track1.mp3" },
  { id: "t2", title: "How We Celebrated Diwali", artist: "Grandma Asha", audioSrc: "/src/assets/track2.mp3" },
  { id: "t3", title: "My Favorite Song", artist: "Grandma Asha", audioSrc: "/src/assets/track3.mp3" },
];

🎛️ Swipe pager (src/components/SwipePager.tsx)

Controlled component handling touch, mouse drag, and keyboard. Props: { index, onIndexChange, children }.
Threshold ~60px. Horizontal-lock. Animate translateX while dragging. Clamp index. Left/Right keys change slides.

💿 Vinyl component (src/components/Vinyl.tsx)

Props:

{ isPlaying: boolean; onToggle: () => void; size?: number; albumCoverSrc: string; }


Render:

A record element that rotates with CSS when isPlaying.

Center label shows the album cover image (circular, contained) so it spins with the record (the image must be a child of the rotating element).

Play/Pause button over the center; clicking record OR button toggles.

src/styles/vinyl.module.css (include these exact hooks):

@keyframes spin { from { transform: rotate(0); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } }

.record {
  width: var(--size, 320px);
  height: var(--size, 320px);
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: relative;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,.25);
  background:
    radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, #222 0 30%, transparent 31%),
    repeating-radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, #111 0 2px, #0f0f0f 3px 4px);
  background-color: #111;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

.spinning { animation: spin 3.2s linear infinite; }
.paused   { animation-play-state: paused; }

.centerWrap {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 50% auto auto 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 36%;
  height: 36%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  overflow: hidden;           /* crop image to a perfect circle */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  border: 2px solid rgba(255,255,255,.1);
}

.labelImg {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;          /* album cover sits perfectly in the circle */
}

.playBtn {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 50% auto auto 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 28%;
  height: 28%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
  background: rgba(255,255,255,.08);
  border: 2px solid rgba(255,255,255,.25);
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  cursor: pointer;
}


Implementation note: The .centerWrap (with <img class="labelImg" src={albumCoverSrc} />) must be inside the .record element so it spins together with the disc when .spinning is applied to .record.

🎚️ Track slide (src/components/TrackSlide.tsx)

Receives a Track and the album.coverSrc as albumCoverSrc.

Holds an <audio> ref. preload="metadata".

On play, apply .spinning; on pause/ended, animation stops (no reset).

Time display MM:SS / MM:SS via timeupdate.

Expose a pause() method/callback so parent pauses during navigation.

🏠 Intro slide (src/components/IntroSlide.tsx)

Shows the album cover image, album title, artist.

Kahani logo pinned bottom-center:

position: fixed; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); bottom: 16px; width: 96px;

Hint text: “Swipe → to start”.

🧠 App logic (src/App.tsx)

State: { index, playingTrackId? }.

Slides: IntroSlide (0) + one TrackSlide per TRACKS.

Pass ALBUM.coverSrc into every Vinyl (so the same image appears in the center label).

On index change, pause any playing audio.

Listen for visibilitychange to auto-pause on tab hide.

Keyboard: Space toggles track play/pause; arrows navigate.

🌈 Styling (src/styles/globals.css)

Dark theme: body { background: #0b0b0b; color: #f5f5f5; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial; }

Use 100dvh heights and safe-area insets.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable spin animations when requested.

🔊 Audio wiring

Native <audio> only. Events: loadedmetadata, timeupdate, play, pause, ended.
Clean up listeners on unmount. Only one <audio> playing at a time.

🧪 Acceptance criteria

On load, I see cover, title, artist, and Kahani logo at bottom-center (logo file is the one attached with this prompt).

Swiping right opens Track 1; swiping left on intro does nothing.

Track screen shows a vinyl with the album cover image in the center:

Play → audio starts and the record (with center image) rotates.

Pause → rotation stops exactly where it is.

Time display updates while playing.

Swipe/drag or Arrow keys move tracks; old audio auto-pauses.

Desktop: Space toggles play/pause; drag left/right works like swipe.

Switching tabs auto-pauses playback.

Layout looks good on phone and desktop.

🚀 Bootstrapping

Init with npm create vite@latest kahani-vinyl -- --template react-ts

Provide placeholder assets in /src/assets/ as listed (logo comes from the file I attached).

Ensure npm i && npm run dev runs a working demo immediately.
