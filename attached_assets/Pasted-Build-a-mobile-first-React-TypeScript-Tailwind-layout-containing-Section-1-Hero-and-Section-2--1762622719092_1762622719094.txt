Build a mobile-first React + TypeScript + Tailwind layout containing Section 1 (Hero) and Section 2 (Scrollable Story Intro + How It Works). Everything must be responsive and optimized for phones (390–430px width).

SECTION 1 (HERO HEADER)

Structure:

Full-width hero section with a background image (use a placeholder for now).

Top-left: Logo (placeholder image).

Top-right: a button labeled Record.

Centered text over the image (white, bold, multi-line):
DADI’S STORIES AND VOICES IN A BOOK

Below the hero, centered button:
Start your free trial

Styling:

Background should have a dark gradient overlay for readability.

Large tap targets for buttons.

Everything mobile-first, rounded edges, soft shadow under navbar, safe-area padding for notch devices.

Props to support later replacement:

backgroundSrc?: string
logoSrc?: string
onRecord?: () => void
onStartTrial?: () => void

SECTION 2 (PROBLEM → VALUE → HOW IT WORKS SCROLLER)

Vertical layout, centered, gentle spacing:

Text block:

Problem statement, bold, centered:
WE REMEMBER THEIR VOICE, BUT FORGET THEIR STORIES. WITH KAHANI, PRESERVE BOTH.

Dummy logo image below (placeholder).

Product value statement (2 lines), centered:
We turn your loved ones’ stories, wisdom, and voice into a beautiful book of memories: easy to create, impossible to forget.

“How It Works” Section:

Title: How This Works (ALONG WITH STOCK IMAGES)

Below it: horizontal scrollable cards (snap scrolling).

Each card:

Placeholder image (16:9)

Title + description:

Step 1: Pick Your Album
Choose the story album you want to create — the one that will capture your family’s heart.

Step 2: Record Your Stories
Share your memories, moments, and wisdom — just speak naturally, and let your stories come alive.

Step 3: Make Your Kahaani Eternal
Your stories are now safely preserved, ready to be cherished for generations.

Step 4: Relish With Your Loved Ones
Play back your kahaani and experience laughter, nostalgia, and warmth with family and friends.

Technical:

Use Tailwind scroll-snap:
scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; scroll-snap-align: start; overflow-x: auto; whitespace-nowrap;

Cards: rounded-2xl, drop-shadow, image on top, text below.

Each image: just use stock placeholder URLs for now.

Default props:

logoSrc?: string
steps?: { title: string; description: string; imageSrc: string; }[]

DELIVERY RULES

Use only Tailwind, no UI libraries.

Export components:

HeroHeader.tsx

ProblemAndHowItWorks.tsx

Also create a demo page app/page.tsx that renders both stacked vertically.
